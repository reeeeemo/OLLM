# OLLM
A Large Learning Model using PyTorch, made for learning purposes.

Everything written is in `OLLM.py`

# How to run OLLM?
I have included two text files, `hamlet_small.txt` and `hamlet.txt`, running `hamlet.txt` on your CPU will prove to be a difficult task, so please **ensure you have CUDA on your device**. Full list of required modules:
- CUDA 12.1 
- Python 3.6-3.11
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy

*I have also left a ton of comments to understand the code and what an LLM is!*
