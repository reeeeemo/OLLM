# OLLM
A Large Learning Model using PyTorch, made for learning purposes.

Everything written is in `OLLM.py`

# How to run OLLM?
I have included a couple text files, both `.csv` and `.txt` will work, you just have to comment/uncomment the code, and change the `process_df` function so it fits your file structure.

Running a large file on your CPU will prove to be a difficult task, so please **ensure you have CUDA on your device**. Here are a handful of modules you will need:
- CUDA 12.1 
- Python 3.6-3.11
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy

*I have also left a ton of comments to understand the code and what an LLM using a Transformer Architecture is!*
